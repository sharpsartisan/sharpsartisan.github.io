				<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

				<h4>Is the use of fractal models useful for modelling miRNA regulatory networks?</h4>
				<p>Using fractal models to model microRNA regulatory networks may be a good idea, but one must be sure that one is modeling a real situation. Self-similarity involves a hierarchical organization of the topology, but it is not certain that the microRNA regulatory network is a hierarchical network or not. It appears to be a network with a high level of degeneracy. In addition, the growing rules are largely unknown, nor is the generative function, nor the scale. Another relevant point is the real pattern of interactions: the competition among microRNAs involve a continuous remodeling of the network and a model that optimises the robustness and degeneracy of the network would be the most accurate for a microRNA network.</p>

				<h4>Which would be the most appropriate fractal dimension definition to compute the regularity of a binary image?</h4>
				<p>Fractal dimension can be used to characterise natural landscape features and rock masses, however every geometrical analysis can be comparable. In such a case, the box-counting method is most likely the most stable. Moreover, it is also capable of providing you with a fractal dimension which is related to both the spatial distribution of objects (in the 2D or in the 3D space) and the frequency size distribution of the same objects.</p>

				<h4>What is the relation between Fractal Space-Time and Scale Relativity?</h4>
				<p>Fractal space-time has no physical existence. It is only the math model. Do not think motion happens in time, because motion happens in space only and time is its duration. </p>

				<h4>Are all Wada basin boundaries fractal?</h4>
				<p>A point X on the basin boundary is a Wada point, if every open neighborhood of X has a nonempty intersection with at least three different basins. The boundary of a basin is called Wada basin boundary. The answer is that a Wada basin is a fractal boundary, but a fractal boundary is not necessarily Wada.</p>

				<h4>What is the exact difference between self-affine and self-similar fractals?</h4>
				<p>Self-affinity is distorted self-similarity. In the case of self-similarity, the objects are scaled by the same amount in all directions, but in self-affinity scaling is not necessary identical in all directions. An affine transformation is imposed on a self-affine structure to witness its self-similarity.</p>
